Ever think of something awesome to do but then when you have time for an activity, you can't think of what you'd like to go do? If you have a banging idea for a night or day out on the town, be sure to add it to the event app! This will ensure optimal enjoyment since all of the details will be organized and laid out for you. When this app is full of events, you can be more eventful. 


## App Instructions:

To start planning, add a spot you'd like to visit by clicking the "Add Location" button, then plug in the address. Next, add an event that you'd like to attend by clicking the "Add Event" button.
